</div>

A CPU software renderer written in C++23. It draws into a plain pixel buffer (no
GPU, no OpenGL) and, for the interactive app, presents it with SDL3; it uses glm
for vector and matrix maths. It began as the University of Bristol computer
graphics coursework ("RedNoise" is the first milestone) and grew into a renderer
with seven ways to draw the Cornell box: a rasteriser, a Whitted ray tracer, a
Monte-Carlo path tracer, a photon mapper, a classic radiosity solver, a
bidirectional path tracer, and a Metropolis light transport sampler.

Everything is verified end to end: the SDL-free engine is unit-tested and
rendered headlessly in CI, which uploads the resulting images as build
artifacts.

## About

RedNoise began as the first milestone of the University of Bristol COMS30020
Computer Graphics unit, where "RedNoise" is literally a window full of random red
pixels. From that starting point it grew, feature by feature, into a renderer
that draws the Cornell box essentially every way the field knows how: a
rasteriser, a Whitted ray tracer, a Monte-Carlo path tracer, a photon mapper,
classic and progressive radiosity, bidirectional path tracing, Metropolis light
transport, and a real-time OpenCL GPU path tracer.

It is the union of four reference course implementations plus more: every
technique taught or demonstrated across those units (rasterisation, all the
global-illumination methods, PBR materials, sub-surface scattering, participating
media, mipmapping, stencil shadows, the meshing/decimation toolkit, analytic
quadrics, spectral and Gerstner oceans, volumetric clouds, and the acceleration
structures) is implemented here, then packaged as an installable library with a
stable C ABI. Each feature was verified by actually looking at a render and by
unit tests, and the whole thing is exercised in CI on every push.

## Features

Rendering modes:

- Wireframe, and a z-buffered rasteriser with full frustum clipping, optional
  backface culling, and a shadow-mapping variant.
- Whitted ray tracer: reflection, refraction, Fresnel, hard and soft shadows.
- Monte-Carlo path tracer: global illumination (colour bleeding), soft shadows,
  and anti-aliasing together.
- Photon mapper: indirect light and caustics, with an optional final gather.
- An OpenCL GPU path tracer that runs the same scene on the GPU in real time
  (progressive accumulation; ~800 fps at 320x240 on an RTX A4000).

Global illumination solvers:

- Classic finite-element radiosity (patch subdivision, Monte-Carlo gathering).
- Bidirectional path tracing (camera and light subpaths, connected).
- Metropolis light transport (PSSMLT: a Markov chain over path space).

Shading and lighting:

- Flat, Gouraud, and Phong shading with per-vertex normals.
- Proximity + angle-of-incidence diffuse, specular highlights, ambient floor.
- Point, directional, and spot lights; area lights give soft shadows; a
  volumetric (3D sphere) emitter gives a wide penumbra.

Materials:

- Diffuse, mirror, glass (Snell + Fresnel), and metallic/roughness (PBR).
- Textured (Wavefront `map_Kd`), procedural (Perlin) and bump/parallax mapping.
- A library of named presets (gold, chrome, copper, emerald, jade, ruby, and
  the classic plastics and rubbers).

Geometry and scenes:

- OBJ/MTL loading with per-vertex normals; analytic spheres, planes, ellipsoids,
  cylinders and cones alongside triangles.
- Object transforms, instancing, and distance-based level of detail.
- A fractal-terrain (Perlin heightfield) generator and an animated
  Gerstner-wave ocean surface.

Camera and image:

- Perspective projection, lookAt, orbit, free-fly, mouse-look, and roll.
- Depth of field and motion blur (in the path tracer).
- Tone-mapping, FXAA, and bloom post-filters; supersampling anti-aliasing.

Performance and output:

- A BVH acceleration structure and OpenMP multithreading.
- PPM/BMP screenshots and numbered PPM frame sequences for video.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the phased build history. Every item on it,
including the GPU path tracer and the ocean-water simulation, is built.

No dependency version is pinned, and there is nothing to install by hand. The
default is **find-first, then fetch**: for each dependency the build looks for a
system package first (instant if you already have it) and only fetches the latest
from upstream when it is missing. So `cmake -B build && cmake --build build` just
works whether or not you have the libraries installed.

| | Dependency | How it's resolved | Notes |
|-|------------|-------------------|-------|
| <img src="assets/logos/glm.png" height="18"> | [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) | System package, else fetched | Header-only; `third_party/glm` is the offline fallback |
| <img src="assets/logos/sdl.png" height="18"> | [SDL3](https://www.libsdl.org) | System package (vcpkg / distro), else fetched + built | Only the interactive app |
| <img src="assets/logos/opencl.png" height="18"> | [OpenCL SDK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-ICD-Loader) | System SDK (vendor / CUDA), else fetched Khronos headers + loader | Only the GPU path tracer |
| <img src="assets/logos/opencl.png" height="18"> | OpenCL runtime | GPU driver | Cannot be fetched: it is the vendor's driver; keep the driver current |
| <img src="assets/logos/openmp.png" height="18"> | [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org) | Compiler | Cannot be fetched: it is a compiler feature (libgomp/libomp/vcomp); optional |

Knobs, if you want to override the default:

- `-DFETCHCONTENT_TRY_FIND_PACKAGE_MODE=NEVER` force-fetches the newest of
  everything, ignoring any system copies.
- `-DFETCH_DEPENDENCIES=OFF` never fetches; it uses only system packages and the
  vendored glm (fully offline).

A C++23 compiler is required (GCC 13+, Clang 17+, or MSVC 19.34+), plus CMake
3.24+ and git. Fetching needs network at configure time.

## Building

Run any binary from the repository root so the relative `assets/` paths resolve.

### CMake (recommended, cross-platform)

```sh
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
./build/RedNoise            # Windows/MSVC: .\build\Release\RedNoise.exe
```

On Windows with [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io), install SDL3 and point CMake at the
toolchain:

```sh
vcpkg install sdl3
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg-root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

### Makefile (Linux/macOS)

Requires `clang++` and SDL3 discoverable via `pkg-config sdl3`:

```sh
make            # debug build, then runs
make production # optimised build
make clean
```

### Headless renderer and tools (no SDL3)

The engine builds without a window. This is what CI runs; it needs no SDL3:

```sh
cmake -B build -S . -DBUILD_APP=OFF
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure          # unit tests

./build/render_headless assets/cornell-box.obj out   # wireframe/rasterised/raytraced PPMs
./build/render_headless assets/cornell-box.obj out 64 # + a 64-sample path-traced PPM
./build/gen_terrain assets/terrain.obj               # generate a fractal terrain mesh
./build/animate assets/cornell-box.obj frame 36      # orbiting camera -> frame-000.ppm ...
./build/render_ocean ocean 24                        # 24 animated ocean frames
```

### GPU path tracer (OpenCL)

Optional and vendor-neutral: standard OpenCL, no CUDA. It builds against whatever
OpenCL SDK is installed (any vendor's, or the Khronos headers + ICD loader; the
CUDA toolkit bundles one) and runs on any conformant device - discrete or
integrated GPU, or even a CPU OpenCL runtime. It enumerates all devices, prefers
a GPU but falls back to anything, and lets you pick. Progressive accumulation
means weaker hardware just converges over more frames rather than failing, so the
same binary scales from a laptop iGPU to a workstation card.

```sh
cmake -B build -S . -DBUILD_GPU=ON      # find_package(OpenCL), uses newest SDK
cmake --build build
./build/gpu_pathtracer --list                                   # list OpenCL devices
./build/gpu_pathtracer assets/cornell-box.obj gpu.ppm 320 240 8 120     # render (auto device)
./build/gpu_pathtracer assets/cornell-box.obj gpu.ppm 320 240 8 120 1   # ... on device index 1
```

The code uses the OpenCL 1.2 API subset for the broadest reach but runs on newer
runtimes (3.0, etc.) at full speed. Require a newer runtime by raising the target
level: `cmake -B build -DBUILD_GPU=ON -DOPENCL_TARGET_VERSION=300`.

## Using it as a library (C API)

The engine installs as a self-contained library with a stable C ABI
(`include/rednoise/rednoise.h`) that exposes no C++ or glm types, so it links
from C and binds cleanly from Rust, Python, and others.

```sh
cmake -B build -S . -DBUILD_APP=OFF
cmake --build build
cmake --install build --prefix /your/prefix
```

Then from a downstream CMake project (`find_package` gives `rednoise::rednoise`):

```cmake
find_package(rednoise REQUIRED)
add_executable(app app.c)
target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE rednoise::rednoise)
# the engine is C++, so the consuming project enables CXX for the link step
```

```c
#include <rednoise/rednoise.h>
rn_scene *scene = rn_scene_load_obj("cornell-box.obj", 0.35f);
unsigned char rgba[320 * 240 * 4];
rn_render(scene, RN_PATHTRACED, 320, 240, 4.0f, 64, rgba);
rn_scene_free(scene);
```

A complete example is in `examples/c_consumer.c`. This C API is also the surface
future Rust / Python / WASM bindings target.

## Editor setup

The repo ships a `compile_flags.txt` so clangd resolves the `framework/`,
`third_party/`, and `src/` include paths without a build. Building once
(`cmake -B build`) additionally writes `build/compile_commands.json`, which
clangd prefers and which carries your machine's SDL3 include path.

## Credits and licence

The `framework/` "sdw" classes originate from the University of Bristol Computer
Graphics unit (COMS30020). The project's own code is under the MIT
[LICENSE](LICENSE); vendored dependencies keep their own licences, listed in
[THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
